# Business-Travel-Analysis
This project analyzes employee demographic data to uncover patterns in business travel and workforce 
distribution across various job roles and departments. The objective is to provide insights that can assist in 
workforce management, talent acquisition, and resource allocation. The analysis includes age demographics, 
business travel frequency, job roles, and departmental distributions. Tableau is used to create a visually 
engaging dashboard that presents these metrics clearly for stakeholders.
